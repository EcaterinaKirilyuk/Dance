            <h1>What is Bachata?</h1>
            <p>Bachata is a social dance originally from the Dominican Republic, which is also widespread in the Latin American countries of the Caribbean.
                On a territorial basis, there are historically formed two directions of bachata: dominican bachata, modern(Bachata Sensual). Bachata Sensual was created by Corke Escalona and Judith Cordero 
                in Spain. In partnering, the lead can decide whether to perform in open, semi-closed or closed position. Dance moves or step variety strongly depend on the music (such as the rhythms played by
                the different instruments), setting, mood, and interpretation. Unlike salsa, bachata dance does not usually include many turn patterns.</p>
