        <p class="textabout"> The origins of kizomba can be traced to late-1970s Africa, with influences variably attributed to Angola. Kizomba is characterised by a slower, romantic, more sensuous rhythm
         than the traditional Angolan semba music. Kizomba music emerged as a fusion of Semba, Angolan Merengue, Kilapanga and further Angolan music influences: It slowed down the cadence 
         of songs and added a stronger bass line to the composition of instruments. Eduardo Paim is internationally recognised as the "father/creator of Kizomba music", as he and his band were
         taking a major role in the development of the music style creation. Most kizomba songs are sung in Portuguese or a dialect from the various Portuguese speaking, African cultures.
