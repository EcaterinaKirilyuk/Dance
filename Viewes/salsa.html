        <h1>What is Salsa?</h1>
        <p> Salsa is a Latin dance associated with the music genre of the same name which was first popularized in the United States in the 1960s in New York City. Salsa is an amalgamation of 
            Cuban dances that were popular in the ballrooms and nightclubs of Havana and New York City and by the end of the 1950s as well as American jazz dances.
            It was primarily developed by Puerto Ricans and Cubans living in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Over the years many different styles of salsa dancing have evolved around the world. Many of them are compatible with each other, but others are different enough to make dancing between 
            dancers of different styles difficult. Incorporating other dance styling techniques into salsa dancing has also become common, with dancers of one style incorporating styles and movements 
            of others to create new fusions of dance styles: New York styles, Los Angeles Style, Cuban Style/Casino, Rueda de Casino. </p>
